Return-To-Lithium
=================

This is the official Git repository for Return-To-Lithium.
Return-To-Lithium is a small group project started by four Computer Science students who felt like using up the little bit of free time they have. It will (hopefully) be a Space/Strategy similar to the popular game FLT but with changes and improvements we would have liked to see in the game.
